## POST 1: Hot Take - Awareness Asymmetry
**Type:** Hot Take
**Pillar:** Thought Leadership
**Best Day:** Wednesday

---

Stop trying to "learn AI."

The problem isn't that you lack AI skills.

The problem is awareness.

We don't have knowledge asymmetry anymore. Everyone can access the same information. Everyone can use the same tools.

The real competitive advantage now?

Knowing what's actually possible.

Most professionals have no idea what AI can do for them. They can't imagine it because they've never seen it done.

This is awareness asymmetry—and it's the new edge.

The people winning right now aren't the ones who took the most courses. They're the ones who simply know what's possible and act on it.

So stop studying AI.

Start discovering what it can actually do for YOUR work.

What's something AI can do that most people in your industry don't realize yet?

## POST 2: Framework - Transparent Equipment
**Type:** Framework/Value
**Pillar:** Educational
**Best Day:** Monday

---

When a skilled musician plays, they don't think about the instrument.

They think about the music. The intention. What they want to create.

The instrument becomes invisible.

This is what we call "transparent equipment"—and it's the goal for AI.

Right now, most people are very aware of AI when they use it:

→ "How do I prompt this?"
→ "Is this the right tool?"
→ "Why isn't it understanding me?"

That friction means AI is still "opaque equipment."

The transformation happens when AI becomes transparent:

→ You have a thought
→ It flows through AI
→ It manifests in the world

No conscious effort. No friction. Just intention → creation.

This doesn't happen through training.
It happens through habit formation.

When you use AI every day for the same types of tasks, it stops being a tool you think about.

It becomes an extension of how you think.

That's the real goal. Not AI literacy. Transparent equipment.

How close are you to this state?

## POST 3: Story - The VP Who Stopped Faking It
**Type:** Story
**Pillar:** Social Proof
**Best Day:** Friday

---

She had been faking it for 2 years.

Every technical meeting, she'd nod along. Pretending to understand the architecture discussions. Hoping no one would ask her opinion.

As the VP of Marketing, she was supposed to sign off on integration plans. But the jargon made her feel like she was reading a foreign language.

Then she tried something different.

Before the next meeting, she took the technical document and asked AI:

"Explain this to me like I'm a marketing professional who needs to understand the business implications, not the technical details."

5 minutes later, she understood not just WHAT the team was proposing, but WHY it mattered for customer experience.

She spotted something in the plan—a gap in data flow that would affect personalization.

In the meeting, she asked a question that stopped the room.

The CTO paused. Then smiled.

"That's... actually a really good catch."

She didn't become a technical expert that day.

She became something more valuable:

A leader who could bridge worlds.

One habit. 5 minutes. Everything changed.

What expertise have you been faking that AI could help you actually understand?

## POST 4: Hot Take - Training Doesn't Work
**Type:** Hot Take
**Pillar:** Thought Leadership
**Best Day:** Wednesday

---

Most AI training is a waste of time.

Here's why:

Traditional AI courses teach you ABOUT AI.
→ What is ChatGPT
→ How LLMs work
→ Prompt engineering tips

But knowing about AI ≠ using AI effectively.

Think about it:

How many courses have you taken where you learned something... and then never applied it?

The forgetting curve is brutal. Within a week, you've lost 80% of what you "learned."

What actually works?

Behavior change, not knowledge transfer.

→ Small daily challenges (4-5 minutes)
→ Real work scenarios (not hypotheticals)
→ Immediate application (not someday)
→ Repeated practice until automatic

You don't need another course.
You need new habits.

The difference?

Courses make you feel like you're making progress.
Habits actually change how you work.

Which would you rather have: a certificate, or a capability?

## POST 5: Framework - The 7 Habits
**Type:** Framework/Value
**Pillar:** Educational
**Best Day:** Monday

---

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Cyborgs:

(Yes, that's a Covey reference. Deal with it.)

1. **EXPLAIN IT**
   Get AI to simplify complex concepts
   → "Explain this like I'm 5"

2. **PLAN IT**
   Create structured approaches
   → "Break this into steps"

3. **CRITIQUE IT**
   Challenge your assumptions
   → "Play devil's advocate"

4. **GUIDE ME**
   Navigate unfamiliar territory
   → "Walk me through this"

5. **IMAGINE IT**
   Explore possibilities
   → "What could this look like?"

6. **WHAT IF**
   Test assumptions
   → "What if we did the opposite?"

7. **IMPROVE IT**
   Refine and enhance
   → "Make this 10% better"

Here's the thing:

You don't need all seven.

Even if you only master three—Explain It, Plan It, Critique It—you're already a thousand times better than before.

These aren't AI skills. They're thinking habits that happen to use AI.

Which three would transform your work the most?

## POST 6: Hot Take - Generalists Win Now
**Type:** Hot Take
**Pillar:** Thought Leadership
**Best Day:** Wednesday

---

For decades, the world rewarded specialists.

"Pick a lane."
"Go deep."
"Become the expert."

AI just flipped the script.

Here's what's happening:

Every cyborg is a data analyst by default.
Every cyborg is an app developer by default.

These are table stakes now.

The scarcity has shifted.

What's scarce isn't specialized knowledge—it's the imagination to combine capabilities in new ways.

AI has given us an incredible gift:

It's taken those of us who have been imaginative and wanted to do a million different things but couldn't specialize in anything...

And given us the power to actually reach more of our potential.

The generalist moment has arrived.

You're going to be coding, testing, writing, designing, thinking about product roadmaps—all in the same week.

Stop feeling guilty about being a generalist.

Start leveraging it as your superpower.

What did you used to think was "not your job" that AI now makes possible?

## POST 7: Framework - Iron Man Model
**Type:** Framework/Value
**Pillar:** Educational
**Best Day:** Monday

---

How do you assess Iron Man's capabilities?

You don't evaluate:
→ Just Tony Stark
→ Just the suit
→ Just JARVIS

You assess all parts together as a functional whole.

This is the Cyborg model.

Human + AI + Tools = Integrated capability system

And here's where most people get it wrong:

They evaluate AI tools in isolation.
"Is ChatGPT good?"
"Is Claude better?"

Wrong question.

The right question:

What can YOU + THIS AI + YOUR WORKFLOW accomplish together?

The same AI that's mediocre for one person is transformational for another.

The difference isn't the AI.

It's the integration.

Three markets are emerging:
1. Humans working alone
2. AI agents working alone
3. Cyborgs (human + AI enhanced)

Each needs different solutions.
Each has different capabilities.
Each plays by different rules.

Which market are you building for?
More importantly—which one are you IN?

## POST 8: Call to Action - Devil's Advocate
**Type:** Value/CTA
**Pillar:** Educational
**Best Day:** Monday

---

If you're not asking AI to destroy your work, you're not getting its full value.

Here's a habit that will 10x your output quality:

Before you ship anything important, ask AI:

"Act as a harsh but constructive critic. Find every weakness in this. Identify what I'm missing. Tell me what a skeptic would say. Be ruthless."

Why this works:

AI has no emotional investment in protecting your feelings.

It won't soften the truth because you worked hard on something.

It won't avoid the uncomfortable observation because it's awkward.

It just... tells you.

The "Critique It" habit is one of the 7 core cyborg habits.

And it might be the most uncomfortable one.

Because hearing "this has problems" never feels good—even from an AI.

But that discomfort?

That's the feeling of improvement.

Pro tip: Don't stop at the first critique. Ask "What else?" three more times.

The real insights come after the obvious problems.

What's something you're about to ship that you should run through the critique machine first?

## POST 9: Future Prediction - The Bottleneck Problem
**Type:** Hot Take/Prediction
**Pillar:** Thought Leadership
**Best Day:** Wednesday

---

Here's an uncomfortable truth about AI productivity:

We keep finding ourselves being the bottleneck.

AI can now:
→ Process an entire literature in hours
→ Generate 50 variations of anything
→ Analyze datasets while you sleep
→ Create content faster than you can review it

The constraint isn't AI capability anymore.

It's human processing speed.

When AI can generate more good ideas in an hour than you can evaluate in a week, something has to change.

The old model: Human creates → AI assists
The new model: AI generates → Human curates

But here's the problem:

How do you maintain meaningful control when you can't possibly review everything?

How do you ensure quality when the volume exceeds your bandwidth?

This is the bottleneck paradox of AI productivity.

And honestly? I don't think we've figured it out yet.

What I do know:

The answer isn't "work faster."
The answer is "think differently about your role."

What's your strategy for staying relevant when AI output exceeds human review capacity?

## POST 10: Hot Take - Taste is Everything
**Type:** Hot Take
**Pillar:** Thought Leadership
**Best Day:** Wednesday

---

AI's biggest risk isn't replacing humans.

It's making everything look the same.

Here's what I'm noticing:

When everyone has access to the same powerful AI tools...

The same prompts get shared...

The same outputs get generated...

And everything starts to feel generic.

What was mindblowing six months ago now looks like everything else.

The differentiator isn't access to AI.

It's taste.

It's intention.

It's the human judgment that says "this isn't quite right" when the AI thinks it nailed it.

Unless you take enough control of AI, it all starts to look the same.

So here's my question:

Are you developing taste?

Or are you just accepting what AI gives you?

Because in a world of infinite AI generation, curation becomes the scarce skill.

The people who win won't be the ones who generate the most.

They'll be the ones who can recognize what's actually good buried in the mountain of mediocre.

How are you developing your taste muscle?
