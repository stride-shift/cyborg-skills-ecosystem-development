# THE CYBORG SKILLS COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK GUIDE
*The Definitive Reference for All Cyborg Skills Concepts*

---

## 1. PHILOSOPHY & FOUNDATION

### Extended Mind Hypothesis
**Definition**: The philosophical theory (Andy Clark, 1998) that cognition extends beyond the boundaries of the individual brain to include external tools and environment.

**Core Insight**: "When Andy Clark and David Thomas published their groundbreaking paper, the extended mind, in 1998, they fundamentally challenged understanding of where cognition happens. The idea that we are extending cognitive ability to create a world with not necessarily humans but cognitively superior cognitive agents."

**Application**: This forms the foundational philosophy of cyborg skills - not just using AI as a tool, but as part of an extended cognitive system where human and AI capabilities become integrated.

### Transparent Equipment
**Definition**: Equipment or tools that become so seamlessly integrated into workflow that they disappear from conscious awareness, effectively extending cognitive capabilities.

**The Musician Analogy**: "When you use a pencil or a musical instrument, you don't think about the pencil. You just think about your intention and it coming into the world. A musician who plays an instrument, the instrument disappears. Their brain just adopts that as like it's an extension of their body and their arms. And they're just willing music into existence."

**Real-World Example**: "I'm finding the same thing with cursor. I'm willing interfaces into existence, operations, everything... it feels like willing something into existence."

**The Goal**: "The ultimate goal is for AI to become transparent where users no longer need to consciously think about using AI. It simply extends their capabilities naturally."

**Why It Matters**: This is the core philosophy behind Cyborg Habits - the goal is not to learn AI tools but to make them transparent equipment that extends human capability.

### Cyborg Definition
**Definition**: Someone who can effectively interact with AI to increase their own potential or capabilities - creating a new functional unit rather than human + AI collaboration.

**Key Clarification**: "A cyborg isn't a scary thing like you might see in science fiction where you have implants. What we mean by a cyborg is somebody who can effectively interact with AI in such a way to increase their own potential or capabilities."

**Already Cyborgs**: "Are we already cyborgs? You're reading this on screen right now... I'm willing to bet you couldn't tell me your best friend's phone number from memory. I just tap their name and my phone does the remembering for me."

**Iron Man as Functional Whole**: "Iron Man is the armor, the AI, and the human being. You wouldn't be assessing Iron Man's abilities and performance unless you considered all the parts together as a functional whole."

**Visual Identity**: The team explicitly rejected typical "cyborg" imagery with chrome and mechanical parts - "This defeats the purpose of cyborg habits... everyone has that going on. It's you - you are a cyborg as soon as it's transparent equipment."

## 2. THE 7 HABITS

### 1. EXPLAIN IT
**Definition**: The habit of asking AI for accessible explanations on demand, removing needless complexity and making critical information accessible.

**Core Value Proposition**: "For the first time in human history, anyone anywhere who has at least a phone can get an accessible explanation on demand."

**How It Works**:
- Ask for explanations tailored to your level ("like I'm five," "like a CEO")
- Request step-by-step breakdowns without assumed knowledge
- Get examples and analogies for complex concepts
- Eliminate the awkwardness of not understanding in meetings or classrooms

**Examples**:
- "Explain it like I'm five, use examples and analogies"
- "Please take me through this step by step, but don't leave out any steps or don't assume any prior knowledge"
- Breaking down technical jargon, complex documents, policies, or unfamiliar concepts

**Common Applications**:
- Understanding meeting content without embarrassment
- Decoding complex administrative documents
- Getting clarity on technical specifications
- Making sense of industry-specific terminology

**At Scale Impact**: "An organization where everybody just understands everything a little bit better. Imagine how significantly differently that organization can perform with increased understanding and improved quality of communication."

**Related Prompts**:
- "Break this down for someone with no background in [topic]"
- "What are the key points I need to understand about [complex topic]?"
- "Explain this using analogies from [familiar domain]"

### 2. PLAN IT
**Definition**: Using AI to create detailed, multi-step strategies for achieving goals, with comprehensive task decomposition and strategic planning.

**Core Function**: "AI helps you create detailed multi-step strategies tailored to your needs, ensuring nothing gets missed and every step is optimized."

**How It Works**:
- Automatically breaks complex tasks into manageable steps
- Identifies potential gaps and dependencies
- Optimizes sequences of actions
- Creates milestone-based project structures

**Examples**:
- "Give me a step-by-step walkthrough on how to do this"
- "Plan four milestones and key dependencies for your current project"
- "Given my role, draft an ideal schedule for tomorrow in five bullets"

**Common Applications**:
- Project planning and milestone creation
- Daily schedule optimization
- Complex problem decomposition
- Strategic approach development

**Challenge Level**: Identified as one of the "harder habits" requiring more mental bandwidth and scaffolding.

**Related Prompts**:
- "Break this project into phases with clear deliverables"
- "What are the critical dependencies I need to consider?"
- "Create a timeline with key milestones for [goal]"

### 3. CRITIQUE IT (DEVIL'S ADVOCATE)
**Definition**: Using AI to systematically challenge assumptions, spot risks, identify flaws, and examine ideas from opposing perspectives.

**Justin's Emphasis**: "Every single cohort that I've had from the beginning... they all say that the thing that blew their mind the most was Devil's Advocate. Everybody agrees. If I could just spend the rest of my life getting everybody on planet Earth to use Devil's Advocate as a matter of course, how much difference that would make."

**How It Works**:
- Systematically challenges assumptions and identifies blind spots
- Provides structured opposition to test idea robustness
- Uses 22 advanced tactics across six categories including Socratic questioning, inversion, role reversal
- Creates structured critique that leads to improvement

**The Process**: "You can say critique this, play devil's advocate, and then devil's advocate rips it to shreds and then you say now how can I improve it, so that tag team is super powerful."

**Examples**:
- "Pick something that you've always just taken for granted and accept it as true and run that through devil's advocate"
- "Play devil's advocate with this business proposal"
- "What are the strongest arguments against this approach?"

**Common Applications**:
- Testing business proposals before presentation
- Challenging long-held assumptions
- Risk identification and mitigation planning
- Strengthening arguments through opposition

**Why It's Powerful**: "The best outcomes don't just happen. They're built by questioning, testing, and refining every step of the way." Consistently rated as most valuable alongside "Improve It."

**Related Prompts**:
- "What are the weakest points in this argument?"
- "Play devil's advocate and challenge every assumption here"
- "What could go wrong with this plan?"

### 4. GUIDE ME (SUGGEST IT)
**Definition**: Getting AI to provide step-by-step guidance through unfamiliar processes or well-reasoned options with pros and cons for decision-making.

**Two Functions**:
1. **Process Guidance**: "Guiding them through it is about physically getting it done, not about guiding them through understanding it"
2. **Decision Support**: "Using AI for suggestions speeds up decision-making, reduces fatigue and provides diverse data-driven insights"

**How It Works**:
- Provides step-by-step process assistance for unfamiliar tasks
- Offers structured options with pros and cons analysis
- Reduces decision fatigue through systematic alternatives
- Acts like a GPS for complex processes

**Examples**:
- "Have it guide you through setting up better spam filters in your email"
- "Have it guide you through using some tech you're not familiar with"
- "Guide me through the process of [unfamiliar task]"

**Common Applications**:
- Technology setup and configuration
- Navigating new software or systems
- Complex decision-making with multiple options
- Learning new processes step-by-step

**Key Benefits**:
- Reduces decision fatigue
- Provides structured alternatives
- Offers data-driven insights
- Generates options you might not consider

**Related Prompts**:
- "Walk me through this process step by step"
- "What are my options here with pros and cons?"
- "Guide me through the best approach to [challenge]"

### 5. IMAGINE IT / WHAT IF
**Definition**: Using AI to explore hypothetical scenarios, envision possibilities, and conduct thought experiments for creative problem-solving.

**Core Function**: "Envision a solution in a completely unusual or unexpected way" and exploring "possible futures or branches of reality."

**How It Works**:
- Explores alternative possibilities and scenarios
- Conducts systematic thought experiments
- Generates creative solutions beyond conventional thinking
- Tests potential consequences before action

**Examples**:
- "What if humans could teleport?" - exploring implications
- "Envision a completely different approach to [problem]"
- "What if we implemented a 4-day work week?"

**Common Applications**:
- Scenario planning and risk assessment
- Creative problem-solving and innovation
- Exploring alternative approaches
- Future-state visioning

**Challenge Level**: One of the "cognitively heavier habits" that "demand energy, time, and mental space" and are "harder to apply consistently under pressure."

**Educational Requirement**: "I need you to watch sci-fi that helps you with thought experiments because we're going to have to output a lot of thought leadership. And often the thought leadership starts with one weird inversion or tweak in reality."

**Related Prompts**:
- "What are three completely different ways to approach this?"
- "What would happen if we inverted this assumption?"
- "Imagine this problem didn't exist - what would be different?"

### 6. IMPROVE IT
**Definition**: The habit of continuously refining and enhancing work output through iterative optimization.

**Core Philosophy**: "You simply don't accept that you've done the best you could. How can I make this better? That's it."

**How It Works**:
- Start with rough approximation or first draft
- Systematically identify enhancement opportunities
- Apply iterative refinement cycles
- Integrate insights from other habits (critique, plan, etc.)

**The Process**: "Getting your rough idea... then what you can do is you can say how can I improve this? How can I improve this further?"

**Integration Power**: "The habits aren't meant to be used in isolation." Works powerfully in combination: "explain and then improve" or "critique then improve."

**Examples**:
- Taking any first draft and asking "How can I make this better?"
- Refining plans based on critique feedback
- Enhancing presentations, documents, or proposals

**Common Applications**:
- Document and presentation refinement
- Process optimization
- Creative work enhancement
- Strategic plan improvement

**Why It's Effective**: Identified as one of the two "strongest value drivers" alongside "Critique It" - "offer immediate improvement. The effect is visible. They are easy to activate. They reduce uncertainty."

**Related Prompts**:
- "How can I make this 10x better?"
- "What would take this from good to excellent?"
- "Refine this based on best practices"

### 7. WHAT IF (Integrated into IMAGINE IT)
**Definition**: Exploring scenarios, consequences, and alternative possibilities through systematic thought experimentation.

**Application**: 
- Testing different approaches before committing
- Scenario planning and risk assessment  
- Exploring potential outcomes and implications

**Integration**: Functions as part of the "Imagine It" habit for comprehensive scenario exploration.

## 3. KEY TERMINOLOGY GLOSSARY

### Awareness Asymmetry
**Definition**: The competitive advantage that comes from being aware of AI capabilities that others don't recognize.

**Justin's Explanation**: "We don't have knowledge asymmetry anymore or skill asymmetry. Everyone can do almost anything that AI allows them to do. The problem is awareness asymmetry. People aren't aware of AI's capabilities. They're not aware of use cases. They're not imagining things that anybody could do."

**Business Implication**: "If you're the first to become aware of it or to imagine it, you have a temporary advantage."

### Behavior Change vs Learning
**Definition**: Focus on changing what people do rather than what they know.

**Core Distinction**: "Cyborg habits is focused on behaviors instead of skills and knowledge. We're not teaching people mental models, not directly. We're not really giving them a framework. We're not giving them skills. We're giving them behavioral tactics that turn into habits."

**Key Difference**: Traditional learning requires stopping work to learn; behavior change happens through work.

### Damascus Moments
**Definition**: Sudden, transformative realizations or breakthrough moments of understanding - from the Bible story of Saul's conversion on the road to Damascus.

**Application**: "Users either have enough repetition for habits to form or experience Damascus moments where they suddenly understand the value and potential."

**Why Important**: These breakthrough moments are key success indicators for the program.

### Functional Whole / Functional Unit
**Definition**: The integrated human-AI system that functions as a single cognitive unit rather than separate collaborating components.

**Concept**: "There is a new functional unit" - not human + AI collaboration, but human-AI integration where "Iron Man is the armor, the AI, and the human being... as a functional whole."

**Identity Shift**: "How do they think about themselves and their identity? Do they see themselves as the human? Do they see themselves as the collective?"

### In-Flow-of-Work
**Definition**: Integrating activities into real work contexts rather than separate learning exercises.

**Implementation**: "Because it's just focusing on things you can already do, every day is just a challenge that is done in the flow of work that can take you between 5 and 10 minutes. Because it's in the flow of work, you get to experience immediately what the real world impact is."

**Why Different**: "It's not like you have to go off and do some abstract thing in a classroom and then you come back and then you never have a chance to apply it to your work."

### Vibe Engineering
**Definition**: End-to-end engineering capability with no traditional engineering skills required.

**Process**: Complete workflow from problem identification → solution design → specifications → schematics → 3D manufacturing, as demonstrated in the potato peeler example: "That is a capability that has never existed in the history of humanity."

## 4. METAPHORS & ANALOGIES BANK

### Iron Man Metaphor
**Complete Framework**: The ideal model for cyborg integration showing how human, AI, and technology function as a unified whole.

**Components**:
- **Human Component (Tony Stark)**: "He might be a genius billionaire playboy, but on his own he can't fly, navigate hypersonic speeds, or survive a direct hit from a missile"
- **AI Component (Jarvis)**: "It supports Iron Man with navigation, threat detection, tactical advice, damage reports, and any other analysis requirements, but without Stark's instructions, it has no goals or motivation"  
- **Equipment Component (The Armor)**: "It's an impressive exoskeleton that gives the wearer superhuman strength, the ability to fly and shoot energy blasts. But without Stark and Jarvis, it's merely an animate shell"

**Key Insight**: "Iron Man is the armor, the AI, and the human being... You wouldn't be assessing Iron Man's abilities and performance unless you considered all the parts together as a functional whole."

### Musician/Instrument Analogy
**Full Explanation**: "Just as a skilled musician doesn't think about their instrument while playing, effortlessly translating thought into music, you'll start using AI not just as a tool but as a natural extension of your thinking."

**Application**: Illustrates transparent equipment - the tool disappears, only intention and output remain visible.

### Pencil Analogy  
**Explanation**: "When you use a pencil, you don't think about the pencil. You just think about your intention and it coming into the world."

**Purpose**: Demonstrates how simple tools become transparent extensions of human capability.

### Hopeful Monster (Ecosystem Analogy)
**Full Story**: "Prior to the industrial revolution, there were lots of white pepper moths... their mechanism for survival was camouflage on white bark trees. There were some slight mutants in the population that were gray and they wouldn't survive. And then the industrial revolution happened. Massive factories, soot everywhere. Those white trees started to go gray. And suddenly the white pepper moths had no advantage. And the gray pepper moths flourished."

**Application**: "The hopeful monster is this little mutant that doesn't quite fit into society or the world, and then suddenly the world changes and they're the fittest of them all." Applied to early AI adopters being ahead of their time.

### GPS Analogy
**Explanation**: "It's like a GPS. You get to where you need to go without having to know how to get there."

**Application**: Illustrates how AI can guide you through processes without requiring deep expertise.

### Button at the Mall Analogy
**Story**: "I just saw somebody had put a little button on the wall by the entrance and it says push to request a wheelchair. Most malls don't have that. It's a small introduction. You just put a button there. It changes everything. Why isn't it everywhere?"

**Application**: Demonstrates how simple AI integrations can transform experiences and organizations.

### Makeup/Cosmetology Analogy
**Philosophy**: "Makeup applied properly enables you to be you, but more you, the you that you want to project... It's you but better. And when we're looking at cyborg habits, people are going to want to be more individual."

**Application**: AI should enhance rather than replace human capability - amplifying individual strengths.

### Netflix Recommendation Analogy
**Concept**: How the system suggests habits like Netflix suggests content, gradually shaping user behavior through personalized recommendations.

**Application**: Describes the adaptive learning approach of the cyborg skills platform.

## 5. POSITIONING & DIFFERENTIATION

### Why This Isn't Traditional Training

**Fundamental Differences**:

| Traditional Training | Cyborg Habits |
|---------------------|---------------|
| "Sit and consume a lot of dry content" | "5-10 minutes a day focusing on habits" |
| "Often classroom or separate experience" | "In the flow of work" |
| "Often on hypothetical test cases" | "On real stuff that moves work forward" |
| "You sit in front of your desk many hours" | "Less demand. Involves knowledge and skills they already have" |
| "Stop work to go and do this" | "Get your work done through it" |
| Knowledge and skills are central | "Knowledge and skills are byproducts" |

**Time Investment**: "Five minute commitment per day just to activate the behavior" vs. traditional learning requiring hours of separate study.

**Focus Difference**: "We're not teaching people mental models, not directly. We're not really giving them a framework. We're not giving them skills. We're giving them behavioral tactics that turn into habits."

### Why This Isn't a Course

**Structure Difference**: "This isn't a traditional program where you sit through hours of lectures or memorize tedious theories and complete complex assignments. Instead, you'll be building productive habits."

**Integration vs. Separation**: Rather than abstract learning disconnected from work, cyborg habits integrates directly into daily work activities.

**Completion Philosophy**: "Completing the program isn't even a requirement. It's just there's this additional need from clients to prove that somebody's completed something and it shows nothing. The goal isn't to get them to finish... The goal is to have them do it day by day and have it spread out over three weeks because it's about taking the time you need to do things repeatedly until they become a habit."

### What Makes It Unique

**1. Behavior Change vs. Knowledge Transfer**
"The program is intentionally designed not as knowledge transfer exercise, but as a behavior change initiative focused on creating experiences that lead to lasting changes in how people work with AI."

**2. Transparent Equipment Goal**
Rather than learning to use AI tools, the goal is making them disappear into workflow - "The ultimate goal is for AI to become transparent where users no longer need to consciously think about using AI."

**3. Functional Whole Approach**
"It's not about how human beings collaborate with AI. There is a new functional unit" - treating human-AI integration as a single entity rather than collaboration.

**4. Existing Capabilities Focus** 
"There's nothing in this course that you cannot already do. It focuses on some things that you can already do, but that you just don't necessarily do frequently enough."

**5. Immediate Value Design**
"The incentive is actually just the value you get. The incentive is the immediacy with which you get a return... The program has been designed so that you get immediate value in the moment."

**6. Deceptively Simple Philosophy**
"Each one seems quite trivial on its own but at scale each one could significantly improve performance... it's deceptively simple but incredibly valuable and it's precisely why it'll be much easier for people to actually adopt."

**7. Experience Design vs. Content Delivery**
"I think of myself as an experience designer. I help to create the opportunities and the experiences that allow change to happen" rather than traditional content-focused training.

**8. Attitude Over Skills**
"The most important thing you can teach is the attitude. Even if you failed to teach them anything about using AI for building a front end, if you had managed to get even three or four of them just to adopt the perspective that they need to give more to get more, then you would have done them a great service."

**9. Table Stakes Capability**
"Every cyborg is also a data analyst by default. Every cyborg is an app developer by default. Every cyborg is a deep researcher by default. These are table stakes."

**10. Identity Transformation**
Moving from "scarcity mindset" to abundance thinking: "Things that used to be scarce are no longer scarce... scarcity or the view that things can't be done because of scarcity, that is a decidedly non-cyborg way of thinking."

---

*This comprehensive framework represents a paradigm shift from traditional training models toward behavioral change and unconscious competence development, using AI as a natural extension of human cognitive capabilities rather than a separate tool to be learned and operated.*
