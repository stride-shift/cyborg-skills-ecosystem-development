## Voice Configuration

### Master Style Prompt

```
Confident, measured delivery. South African international neutral accent - clear and professional, no regional markers. Pace: unhurried, giving ideas room to land. Tone: intelligent colleague explaining something useful, not a presenter selling something. Dry wit where it appears naturally. No uptalk, no performed enthusiasm. Think: someone who knows their subject and respects the listener's intelligence.
```

### Technical Settings

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Model | `gemini-2.5-flash-tts` or `gemini-2.5-pro-tts` |
| Voice | `Kore` (Female) |
| Language Code | `en-US` |
| Sample Rate | 24000 Hz |

### Inline Tags - Use Sparingly

| Tag | When to use |
|-----|-------------|
| `[short pause]` | Before a key point lands, not after every phrase |
| `[uhm]` | Rare - only for genuine thinking moments |

Avoid: `[whispering]`, `[laughing]`, `[sigh]` - these tend toward theatrical.

## Category 1: Extended Cognition

### 1.1 Cognitive Parallelism

```
Cognitive Parallelism. The ability to pursue multiple lines of thought simultaneously.

Instead of working through Option A, then B, then C in sequence, you explore all three at once. Your thinking branches rather than proceeding linearly.

What this feels like in practice: you're comparing three approaches in real-time, not reconstructing each from memory.

The AI holds the threads. You weave the pattern.
```

---

### 1.2 Working Memory Expansion

```
Working Memory Expansion. The ability to hold vastly more context than biological memory allows.

Complex systems, long histories, intricate relationships - normally your brain simplifies these. It has to. There's only so much you can keep in mind at once.

This skill removes that ceiling. Everything relevant stays available, without the usual decay or compression.

What it feels like: you can track everything without forgetting or having to choose what to keep.
```

---

### 1.3 Instant Externalization

```
Instant Externalization. The ability to crystallize vague intuitions into structured form, immediately.

You know that state where you sense something's right but can't quite articulate it? The idea's there, half-formed.

This skill makes tacit knowledge explicit. The half-formed thought becomes complete before it can fade.

What it feels like: you know what you think the moment you think it. In full detail.
```

---

### 1.4 Lossless Context Switching

```
Lossless Context Switching. The ability to move between tasks without cognitive reload time.

We all know the cost of switching projects - twenty minutes remembering where you were, what you were thinking, why you made certain choices.

This skill eliminates that tax. Every thread stays fully loaded. You pick up exactly where you left off, even months later.

Context never goes cold.
```

---

## Category 2: Perspective Multiplication

### 2.1 Stance Shifting

```
Stance Shifting. The ability to genuinely occupy unfamiliar viewpoints.

Not just understanding how a lawyer thinks, but actually thinking like one. Then a designer. Then a skeptic. Moving fluidly between them.

This isn't empathy as imagination. It's perspective as tool - different expertise, different values, different assumptions, all accessible on demand.

You're no longer limited to your own lens.
```

---

### 2.2 Adversarial Self-Examination

```
Adversarial Self-Examination. The ability to attack your own ideas with genuine force.

The problem with self-critique is that we go easy on ourselves. We raise weak objections we can easily dismiss. It's human nature.

This skill gives you the strongest possible counter-arguments. The real holes. The actual vulnerabilities.

Better to find weaknesses privately than have someone else find them publicly.
```

---

### 2.3 Audience Simulation

```
Audience Simulation. The ability to predict how different people will receive your communication.

Not guessing. Actually modeling comprehension. How will the engineer interpret this? The executive? The skeptical customer?

Before you send, present, or publish, you already know how it will land.

Communication becomes less risky when you can preview the reaction.
```

---

### 2.4 Assumption Surfacing

```
Assumption Surfacing. The ability to identify what you're taking for granted.

The hardest things to see are the things so obvious to you that you don't realise others don't share them. Invisible premises. Hidden assumptions.

This skill makes them visible. You can see your own blind spots - or at least, more of them than you could before.

The assumptions you don't know you're making are usually the dangerous ones.
```

---

## Category 3: Temporal Manipulation

### 3.1 Compressed Pattern Recognition

```
Compressed Pattern Recognition. The ability to acquire pattern recognition that normally requires years of experience - in hours.

Not expertise exactly. But the ability to recognise what expertise recognises. To see what veterans see, faster than you'd expect.

Years of exposure compress into hours of structured learning.

You're not replacing experience. You're accelerating toward it.
```

---

### 3.2 Accelerated Iteration

```
Accelerated Iteration. The ability to run through versions at speeds that allow rapid convergence.

Ten iterations in the time one would normally take. Draft, feedback, revision - the cycle compresses.

When iteration is this cheap, you can try everything. Find what works through exploration rather than speculation.

Perfectionism becomes practical when refinement is fast.
```

---

### 3.3 Future Simulation

```
Future Simulation. The ability to play out scenarios with enough fidelity to make better decisions.

Not prediction - that's usually overconfident. Structured imagination of what might happen. Exploring downstream before you're there.

You identify risks before they materialise. Opportunities before they pass.

The future becomes less surprising when you've already walked through the possibilities.
```

---

### 3.4 Experience Compression

```
Experience Compression. The ability to extract learnings from experiences - yours or others' - that would normally require living through them slowly.

A career's worth of situations, analysed in an afternoon. Patterns extracted. Lessons crystallised.

You learn from experience without needing all the time experience usually demands.
```

---

## Category 4: Scale Fluidity

### 4.1 Zoom Control

```
Zoom Control. The ability to move between micro-details and macro-patterns at will.

Seeing the individual tree. Seeing the forest. Switching instantly between them without losing either view.

You understand how small things connect to big pictures. Details inform strategy. Strategy informs details.

Altitude becomes a choice, not a constraint.
```

---

### 4.2 Cascade Awareness

```
Cascade Awareness. The ability to trace how small changes propagate through complex systems.

Second-order effects. Unintended consequences. Ripple mapping.

You see where things lead - not just immediate impact, but downstream implications.

Consequences become visible before they become problems.
```

---

### 4.3 Complexity Absorption

```
Complexity Absorption. The ability to take in complex systems and find the essential structure.

Not simplification that loses truth - compression that preserves it. You hold complexity without being overwhelmed.

The signal emerges from the noise. The pattern reveals itself.

Complicated becomes manageable without becoming simplistic.
```

---

### 4.4 Granularity Matching

```
Granularity Matching. The ability to operate at exactly the right level of detail for the task.

Not too abstract, not too specific. Calibrated precision.

Some problems need broad strokes. Others need fine detail. You match the resolution to the requirement.

The right level of detail is simply the one that serves the purpose.
```

---

## Category 5: Generative Capacity

### 5.1 Variation Production

```
Variation Production. The ability to generate multiple versions of anything.

Not just one solution - a landscape of solutions to choose from. Options multiply.

You see many ways this could work. Then you choose.

Choice requires options. This skill produces them.
```

---

### 5.2 Adjacent Possible Navigation

```
Adjacent Possible Navigation. The ability to find next steps that are actually achievable from where you are.

Not fantasy. Feasible moves. What's within reach right now.

You see the path forward - not the distant destination, but the next actual step.

Progress happens through possible moves, not impossible leaps.
```

---

### 5.3 Constraint Inversion

```
Constraint Inversion. The ability to turn limitations into creative fuel.

Taking what seems like a restriction and finding what it enables. Working with constraints rather than against them.

Boundaries often define the interesting space. The limitation sometimes is the gift.
```

---

### 5.4 Blank Page Elimination

```
Blank Page Elimination. The ability to never start from nothing.

The empty page, the blinking cursor, the paralysis of beginning - these disappear.

You always have something to respond to. To refine. To reject. Starting becomes reacting.

The hardest part of creation is often beginning. This skill sidesteps it.
```

---

## Category 6: Translation Capacity

### 6.1 Domain Bridging

```
Domain Bridging. The ability to carry insights from one field into another.

Seeing how a solution in biology applies to organisations. How physics principles inform business strategy. Pattern transfer across domains.

Knowledge becomes portable. You can borrow from anywhere.

The best ideas often come from unexpected places.
```

---

### 6.2 Jargon Traversal

```
Jargon Traversal. The ability to move between technical languages without getting lost.

Medical language. Legal language. Engineering language. Financial language. Each has its own vocabulary, its own assumptions.

You can speak to specialists in their terms. Barriers dissolve.

Communication requires shared vocabulary. This skill provides it.
```

---

### 6.3 Format Fluidity

```
Format Fluidity. The ability to move between representations - visual, verbal, structured, narrative - while preserving meaning.

The same idea as a diagram. As a story. As a bullet list. As a conversation.

Each format serves different purposes. Ideas become adaptable - they flow into whatever container serves them best.
```

---

### 6.4 Abstraction Bridging

```
Abstraction Bridging. The ability to connect abstract principles to concrete instances, and vice versa.

Theory to practice. Practice to theory. Moving between ideas and action fluidly.

You understand principles through examples. You derive principles from examples.

Understanding travels in both directions.
```

---

## Category 7: Reality Testing

### 7.1 Calibration Checking

```
Calibration Checking. The ability to test whether your confidence matches the evidence.

Are you overconfident? Underconfident? Getting a read on your own certainty.

Beliefs get reality-tested before decisions get made.

Confidence should match evidence. This skill helps ensure it does.
```

---

### 7.2 Edge Case Discovery

```
Edge Case Discovery. The ability to find situations that break your model.

Where does this stop working? What's the exception? The corner case? The boundary condition?

You find where your thinking fails before reality does it for you.

Models are useful until they're not. Better to know where that line is.
```

---

### 7.3 Contradiction Detection

```
Contradiction Detection. The ability to identify when you're holding incompatible beliefs.

Internal inconsistencies. Things that can't all be true at once. Logic that doesn't add up.

Contradictions surface before they cause problems.

Consistency matters. This skill protects it.
```

---

### 7.4 Completeness Sensing

```
Completeness Sensing. The ability to know whether you've covered the territory.

What's missing? What haven't you considered? What's left unexplored?

You can tell when you're not done thinking. Gaps become visible.

Knowing what you don't know is knowing something important.
```

---

## Category 8: Synthesis Creation

### 8.1 Pattern Integration

```
Pattern Integration. The ability to find the structure that makes disparate elements cohere.

What's the framework that holds these together? The pattern underneath the apparent chaos?

Disconnected pieces become connected wholes. You find the shape in the noise.
```

---

### 8.2 Tension Resolution

```
Tension Resolution. The ability to find positions that honour competing demands.

Not compromise - synthesis that transcends the opposition.

You find the both-and instead of the either-or. Sometimes the answer isn't choosing between options. It's integrating them.
```

---

### 8.3 Narrative Construction

```
Narrative Construction. The ability to build coherent stories from scattered information.

Meaning-making. Why this matters. How it connects. What it means.

Information becomes understanding. Data becomes story.

Humans understand through narrative. This skill builds it.
```

---

### 8.4 Framework Building

```
Framework Building. The ability to construct mental models that organise understanding.

Not borrowing frameworks - creating them. Building your own way of seeing.

You develop lenses that make complexity comprehensible. Custom tools for understanding.

The best frameworks are often the ones built for the specific situation.
```

---

## Category 9: Precision Enhancement

### 9.1 Disambiguation

```
Disambiguation. The ability to identify and resolve unclear communication.

What exactly do you mean? What exactly do I mean? Making the vague specific.

Clarity emerges from confusion. Misunderstanding gets prevented before it happens.

Most problems are communication problems. This skill prevents many of them.
```

---

### 9.2 Error Catching

```
Error Catching. The ability to detect mistakes before they compound.

Typos. Logical errors. Wrong assumptions. Caught early, while they're still easy to fix.

Small errors become big problems if you let them. This skill catches them.
```

---

### 9.3 Omission Detection

```
Omission Detection. The ability to notice what's not there.

What got left out? What wasn't mentioned? The dog that didn't bark.

Absence becomes visible.

Sometimes the most important thing is what isn't said.
```

---

### 9.4 Precision Calibration

```
Precision Calibration. The ability to be exactly as precise as needed.

Not vaguer than necessary. Not more specific than useful.

You match precision to purpose.

Over-precision wastes effort. Under-precision causes errors. Balance matters.
```

---

## Category 10: Meta-Cognitive Enhancement

### 10.1 Process Awareness

```
Process Awareness. The ability to observe your own cognitive process.

Not just thinking - watching yourself think. Seeing how you're approaching the problem.

Metacognition in action.

Awareness of process is the first step toward improvement of process.
```

---

### 10.2 Strategy Selection

```
Strategy Selection. The ability to choose the right thinking approach for the problem.

Not one-size-fits-all. Matched methods.

Different problems need different strategies. You know which tool fits which job.

Strategic thinking starts with choosing the right strategy.
```

---

### 10.3 Cognitive Offloading

```
Cognitive Offloading. The ability to consciously decide what to hold in mind versus externalise.

Managing cognitive load intentionally. Not everything needs to live in your head.

You free up mental space for what matters most.

Your brain is for thinking, not storage.
```

---

### 10.4 Attention Direction

```
Attention Direction. The ability to focus on what's most important when everything seems important.

Signal detection in noise. Finding what deserves your focus.

Priority becomes clear.

In a world of infinite information, attention is the scarce resource.
```
