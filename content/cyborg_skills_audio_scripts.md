# Cyborg Skills Audio Scripts

**40 Short-Form TTS Scripts for the Cyborg Skills Taxonomy**

These scripts are optimized for Gemini TTS with consistent voice direction and inline tags.
Target duration: 30-45 seconds each (bite-sized skill introductions)

---

## Voice Consistency Configuration

### Master Style Prompt (Use for ALL scripts)

```
Speak with genuine warmth and intellectual curiosity. South African international neutral accent - clear, professional, globally accessible. No regional markers or uptalk. Moderate pace, unhurried but not slow. Vary emphasis naturally to highlight key insights. Sound like a thoughtful guide sharing something genuinely useful, not a presenter performing. Authoritative but approachable. BBC World Service meets South African warmth.
```

### Technical Settings (Consistent Across All Generations)

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Model | `gemini-2.5-flash-tts` or `gemini-2.5-pro-tts` |
| Voice | `Kore` (Female) - recommended for warmth |
| Language Code | `en-US` |
| Sample Rate | 24000 Hz |
| Output Format | WAV or MP3 |

### Voice Consistency Tips

1. **Always use the same voice** (`Kore`) across all 40 scripts
2. **Use identical style prompts** - copy the master prompt exactly
3. **Maintain consistent technical settings** - same model, sample rate, language code
4. **Process in batches** - generate related categories together
5. **Review for tonal drift** - if later scripts sound different, regenerate with explicit prompt reinforcement

## Category 1: Extended Cognition (Skills 1.1-1.4)

### Skill 1.1: Cognitive Parallelism

**Inline Script:**

```
Cognitive Parallelism. [short pause] The ability to pursue multiple lines of thought simultaneously.

Here's what changes. Instead of thinking through Option A, [uhm] then Option B, then Option C in sequence [short pause] you explore all three at once. Your thinking branches rather than proceeding linearly.

[whispering] What it feels like? "I'm considering three approaches at once and comparing them in real-time."

This isn't multitasking. It's parallel processing. The AI holds the threads while you weave the pattern.
```

---

### Skill 1.2: Working Memory Expansion

**Inline Script:**

```
Working Memory Expansion. [short pause] The ability to hold vastly more context than biological memory allows.

Not anymore. [short pause] Everything relevant stays available. Without loss.

[whispering] What it feels like? "I can keep track of everything relevant without forgetting or simplifying."

Your mind's RAM just got an upgrade.
```

---

**Inline Script:**

```
Instant Externalization. [short pause] The ability to immediately crystallize vague intuitions into structured form.

No more losing insights because you couldn't capture them fast enough.
```

Your work never goes cold.
```

---

## Category 2: Perspective Multiplication (Skills 2.1-2.4)

**Inline Script:**

```
Adversarial Self-Examination. [short pause] The ability to attack your own ideas with genuine force.

## Production Guide

### Generating Consistent Audio

**Step 1: Set Up Your Generation Script**

```python
# Master style prompt - use EXACTLY this for all scripts
MASTER_STYLE_PROMPT = """Speak with genuine warmth and intellectual curiosity. South African international neutral accent - clear, professional, globally accessible. No regional markers or uptalk. Moderate pace, unhurried but not slow. Vary emphasis naturally to highlight key insights. Sound like a thoughtful guide sharing something genuinely useful, not a presenter performing. Authoritative but approachable. BBC World Service meets South African warmth."""

# Voice settings - NEVER change these
VOICE_NAME = "Kore"  # Use Kore for all 40 scripts
LANGUAGE_CODE = "en-US"
MODEL = "gemini-2.5-flash-tts"  # or gemini-2.5-pro-tts for higher quality
```

**Step 2: Format Each Script**

```python
# Combine prompt and text for API
full_content = f"{MASTER_STYLE_PROMPT}: {script_text}"
```

**Step 3: Generate in Category Batches**

Process skills by category (1-10) to maintain thematic consistency:
- Category 1: Extended Cognition (1.1-1.4)
- Category 2: Perspective Multiplication (2.1-2.4)
- etc.
