# Accent Guide: International Neutral South African English

This guide ensures voice performances sound professional, globally accessible, and free of detectable regional markers while maintaining the natural warmth of South African English.

## Core Principles

### 1. Vowel Neutralization

| Avoid | Use Instead | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Flat "a" (æ) | Open "ah" (ɑ) | "chance" → not "chænce" |
| Clipped "i" | Full "ee" | "been" → "been" not "bin" |
| Rounded "o" | Neutral "o" | "no" → clean, not elongated |
| Diphthong shifts | Standard diphthongs | "day" → "day" not "die" |

### 2. Consonant Clarity

- **T's and D's**: Fully articulate, no glottal stops
- **R's**: Non-rhotic (don't roll or emphasize final R's)
- **TH sounds**: Clear dental fricatives (not "d" or "f" substitutions)
- **L's**: Light, not dark or heavy

### 3. Rhythm and Cadence

- **Pace**: Moderate, unhurried but not slow
- **Stress**: Even stress patterns, avoid syllable-timed rhythm
- **Intonation**: Gentle rises and falls, no dramatic pitch swings
- **Sentence endings**: Declarative (down), not uptalk (up)

## What to Avoid

### South African Markers
- "Ja" or "né" interjections
- Rising intonation on statements
- Afrikaans-influenced vowel sounds
- Clipped word endings
- "Actually" pronounced "ek-chully"

### British Markers
- Received Pronunciation affectations
- Overly formal or "posh" sounds
- Elongated vowels ("rahther")

### American Markers
- Rhotic R's (hard R sounds)
- Flat A's ("cæn" instead of "cahn")
- T-flapping ("wader" for "water")

## Target Sound Profile

Think: **BBC World Service meets South African warmth**

- Clear and crisp articulation
- Warm but not overly familiar tone
- Professional without being cold
- Educated without being pretentious
- Globally understood without regional tells

## Practical Tips for Voice Performance

1. **Breathe**: Support from the diaphragm for consistent tone
2. **Slow down**: Rushing reveals accent habits
3. **Record and listen**: Check for slipping into regional patterns
4. **Mouth position**: Keep relaxed, slightly open jaw
5. **Think "news anchor"**: Authoritative but approachable
