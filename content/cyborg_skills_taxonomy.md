# Cyborg Skills Taxonomy

**Genuine cognitive capabilities that emerge when AI is transparent equipment**

These are not use cases. These are new abilities—things you can DO that you couldn't do before. The difference:
- Use case: "Turn meeting notes into a summary"
- Skill: "Parallel cognitive processing" or "Instant externalization"

---

## Category 1: Extended Cognition

Skills that expand the boundaries of what your mind can hold and process.

### 1.1 Cognitive Parallelism
The ability to pursue multiple lines of thought simultaneously. You can explore Option A, B, and C in parallel rather than sequentially. Your thinking branches rather than proceeding linearly.

*What it feels like:* "I'm considering three approaches at once and comparing them in real-time."

### 1.2 Working Memory Expansion
The ability to hold vastly more context than biological memory allows. Complex systems, long histories, intricate relationships—all available without loss.

*What it feels like:* "I can keep track of everything relevant without forgetting or simplifying."

### 1.3 Instant Externalization
The ability to immediately crystallize vague intuitions into structured form. Tacit knowledge becomes explicit. Half-formed thoughts become complete.

*What it feels like:* "I know what I think the moment I think it, in full detail."

### 1.4 Lossless Context Switching
The ability to move between tasks, domains, or problems without the cognitive cost of reloading context. Every thread remains fully available.

*What it feels like:* "I can pick up exactly where I left off, even after months."

---

## Category 2: Perspective Multiplication

Skills that let you see from viewpoints beyond your own.

### 2.1 Stance Shifting
The ability to genuinely occupy unfamiliar viewpoints—not just understand them intellectually, but think from within them. Different expertise, different values, different assumptions.

*What it feels like:* "I can think like a lawyer, then a designer, then a skeptic, fluidly."

### 2.2 Adversarial Self-Examination
The ability to attack your own ideas with genuine force. Not weak objections you can easily dismiss, but the strongest possible counter-arguments.

*What it feels like:* "I can find the holes in my own thinking before others do."

### 2.3 Audience Simulation
The ability to predict how different people will receive and interpret your communication. Not guessing—actually modeling their comprehension.

*What it feels like:* "I know how this will land before I say it."

### 2.4 Assumption Surfacing
The ability to identify what you're taking for granted. The invisible premises. The things so obvious to you that you don't realize others don't share them.

*What it feels like:* "I can see my own blind spots."

---

## Category 3: Temporal Manipulation

Skills that change your relationship with time and learning.

### 3.1 Compressed Pattern Recognition
The ability to acquire pattern recognition that normally requires years of experience in hours. Not expertise—but the ability to recognize what expertise recognizes.

*What it feels like:* "I can see what veterans see, faster than I should."

### 3.2 Accelerated Iteration
The ability to run through versions, drafts, and attempts at speeds that allow rapid convergence. Ten iterations in the time one would take.

*What it feels like:* "I can try everything and find what works."

### 3.3 Future Simulation
The ability to play out scenarios with enough fidelity to make better decisions. Not prediction—structured imagination of what might happen.

*What it feels like:* "I can see downstream before I'm there."

### 3.4 Experience Compression
The ability to extract learnings from experiences (yours or others') that would normally require living through them slowly.

*What it feels like:* "I can learn from a career's worth of situations in an afternoon."

---

## Category 4: Scale Fluidity

Skills that let you move between levels of detail and abstraction.

### 4.1 Zoom Control
The ability to move between micro-details and macro-patterns at will. Seeing both the individual tree and the forest, switching instantly.

*What it feels like:* "I can see how this small thing connects to the big picture."

### 4.2 Cascade Awareness
The ability to trace how small changes propagate through complex systems. Second-order effects. Unintended consequences. Ripple mapping.

*What it feels like:* "I can see where this leads."

### 4.3 Complexity Absorption
The ability to take in complex systems and find the essential structure. Not simplification that loses truth—compression that preserves it.

*What it feels like:* "I can hold complexity without being overwhelmed."

### 4.4 Granularity Matching
The ability to operate at the right level of detail for the task. Not too abstract, not too specific. Calibrated precision.

*What it feels like:* "I'm at exactly the right altitude for this problem."

---

## Category 5: Generative Capacity

Skills that produce options, variations, and possibilities.

### 5.1 Variation Production
The ability to generate multiple versions of anything. Not just one solution—a landscape of solutions to choose from.

*What it feels like:* "I can see many ways this could work."

### 5.2 Adjacent Possible Navigation
The ability to find the next steps that are actually achievable from where you are. Not fantasy—feasible moves.

*What it feels like:* "I can see what's within reach."

### 5.3 Constraint Inversion
The ability to turn limitations into creative fuel. Taking what seems like a restriction and finding what it enables.

*What it feels like:* "I can work with constraints rather than against them."

### 5.4 Blank Page Elimination
The ability to never start from nothing. Always having something to respond to, refine, or reject.

*What it feels like:* "I never face the empty page alone."

---

## Category 6: Translation Capacity

Skills that bridge gaps between domains, languages, and forms.

*What it feels like:* "I can shape ideas into whatever container serves them."

### 6.4 Abstraction Bridging
The ability to connect abstract principles to concrete instances, and vice versa. Theory to practice, practice to theory.

*What it feels like:* "I can move between ideas and action."

---

## Category 7: Reality Testing

Skills that check your thinking against reality.

## The Fundamental Insight

These skills share a common structure: they turn AI into **transparent equipment** that extends cognition rather than replacing it. The human remains the thinker, the decider, the meaning-maker. But the boundaries of what that human mind can do have expanded.

This is the cyborg advantage: not doing tasks faster, but thinking in ways that weren't possible before.

## Mapping to the 7 Habits

Each cyborg skill connects to one or more of the foundational habits:

| Skill Category | Primary Habit Connection |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| Extended Cognition | Explain It (externalization) |
| Perspective Multiplication | Critique It (adversarial thinking) |
| Temporal Manipulation | Guide Me (accelerated learning) |
| Scale Fluidity | Plan It (seeing consequences) |
| Generative Capacity | Imagine It (possibility space) |
| Translation Capacity | Improve It (format optimization) |
| Reality Testing | What If (stress testing) |
| Synthesis Creation | All habits in concert |
| Precision Enhancement | Improve It (refinement) |
| Meta-Cognitive Enhancement | All habits (awareness of process) |

## What Makes These "Cyborg-Only"?

A skill is cyborg-only if:
1. **Neither human nor AI can do it alone** - It requires the combination
2. **The human remains in the loop** - Not automation, augmentation
3. **It changes what's cognitively possible** - Not just faster, but different
4. **It becomes transparent with practice** - The AI disappears into the capability

These aren't about using AI as a tool. They're about AI becoming part of how you think.
