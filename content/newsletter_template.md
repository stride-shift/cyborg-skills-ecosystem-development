## Welcome to The Cyborg Weekly

You're reading the first edition of The Cyborg Weekly—a newsletter dedicated to helping you work, think, and create better with AI.

But here's the thing: we're not here to teach you about AI.

We're here to help you build habits that make AI invisible. Like a musician who doesn't think about their instrument while playing, we want AI to become "transparent equipment"—a seamless extension of your thinking.

Every week, we'll share:
- One skill you can use immediately
- Insights on human-AI collaboration
- Stories of transformation
- Tools and prompts worth knowing

Let's build your cyborg future together.

## 🎯 SKILL OF THE WEEK: Explain It Like I'm Five

**The Skill:** Getting AI to simplify complex concepts into clear, accessible explanations.

**When to Use It:**
- Preparing for a meeting on an unfamiliar topic
- Reviewing technical documents outside your expertise
- Learning something new quickly

**Try This Prompt:**
"Explain [concept] to me like I'm five years old. Use simple words and a concrete analogy."

**Pro Tip:** After the simple explanation, ask "Now explain it like I'm a smart professional who's just unfamiliar with this field" for more nuance.

## ⚡ QUICK HITS

**The Awareness Gap**: The real competitive advantage isn't knowing more—it's being aware of what's possible. Most people still don't know what AI can do for them.

**Behavior > Knowledge**: Every study shows that knowing how to use AI doesn't mean you will. That's why we focus on habit formation, not training.

**AI as Thinking Partner**: The shift isn't from human work to AI work. It's from human alone to human+AI as an integrated whole.

**The 5-Minute Test**: If you can't use a new AI skill in under 5 minutes on real work, you probably won't use it at all.

## 💬 QUOTE OF THE WEEK

"It's not about knowledge asymmetry anymore. Everyone can access information. It's about awareness asymmetry. People just don't know what's possible."

— Justin Germishuys

The new edge isn't what you know—it's knowing what's possible.
