## Open Questions

1. **Presenter**: Use Kiyasha avatar, new brand avatar, or multiple presenters?

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| AI tool changes make demos outdated | Content becomes stale | Design for concepts over specific tools, plan annual refresh |
| Production bottleneck | Delays in release schedule | Batch production, template efficiency |
| Low engagement on some skills | Wasted production effort | Start with highest-value skills, pivot based on data |
| Avatar/voice uncanny valley | Viewer distrust | High-quality production, human touches |
| Scope creep on video length | 5-min rule broken | Strict editing, split into parts if needed |

## Sample Script Outline (Skill #1: Meeting to Summary)

**Title**: Turn Any Meeting into an Actionable Summary in 60 Seconds

**Hook** (10 sec):
"What if your meeting notes wrote themselves—and actually captured what mattered?"

**Context** (30 sec):
"Most people leave meetings with scattered notes or worse, no notes at all. The information discussed starts fading within hours. But with this skill, you'll turn any meeting transcript into a structured, actionable summary before you've even left the room."

**Demo** (3 min):
1. Show raw meeting transcript (messy, long)
2. Demonstrate prompt: "Summarize this meeting with: key decisions, action items with owners, open questions, and next steps"
3. Show AI output
4. Refine: "Add deadlines mentioned and highlight any risks discussed"
5. Show improved output
6. Quick variation: "Now create a 2-sentence version for Slack"

**Summary** (20 sec):
"Meeting to Summary is your first step toward 'Meeting to Execution.' Start with summaries, then graduate to having AI draft the actual deliverables discussed. The meeting ends, the work begins automatically."

**CTA** (10 sec):
"Try this with your next meeting transcript. Next week: Meeting to Execution—going beyond summaries to actual outputs."
