## Appendix: Sample Posts

### Framework Post Example
```
Stop trying to "learn AI."

Instead, build these 7 habits:

1. Explain It
   → Get AI to simplify complex things

2. Plan It
   → Let AI structure your thinking

3. Critique It
   → Use AI as devil's advocate

4. Guide Me
   → Get step-by-step help for new tasks

5. Imagine It
   → Explore possibilities with AI

6. What If
   → Test assumptions and scenarios

7. Improve It
   → Iteratively enhance your work

The goal isn't to master AI tools.

It's to make AI invisible—like a musician doesn't think about their instrument.

That's what we call "transparent equipment."

Which habit would change your work most?
```

### Hot Take Example
```
AI training is mostly a waste of time.

Here's why:

Most "AI training" teaches you about AI.
- What is ChatGPT
- How LLMs work
- Prompt engineering tips

But knowing about AI ≠ using AI effectively.

What actually works?

Behavior change.

Small daily challenges.
Real work scenarios.
Repeated practice until it's automatic.

You don't need another course.
You need new habits.

Disagree? Tell me why.
```

### Story Post Example
```
Last month, a VP admitted something embarrassing.

She'd been faking it in technical meetings for 2 years.

Nodding along. Pretending to understand.
Hoping no one would ask her a question.

Then she tried one thing differently.

Before each meeting, she'd take the agenda and ask AI:
"Explain these topics to me like I'm a smart non-technical person."

5 minutes of prep.

In the next meeting, she asked a question that stopped the room.

The CTO paused, then said: "That's actually a really good catch."

She didn't become a technical expert.

She became something more valuable: a leader who could bridge worlds.

One habit. 5 minutes. Everything changed.
```
