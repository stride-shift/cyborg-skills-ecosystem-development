## Sample Micro-Story (Chapter 4: Explain It)

> Sarah had stared at the technical architecture document for twenty minutes. As the new VP of Marketing, she was expected to sign off on the integration plan, but the jargon made her feel like she was reading a foreign language.
>
> "Explain this document to me like I'm a marketing professional who needs to understand the business implications, not the technical details," she typed.
>
> Three minutes later, she understood not just what the team was proposing, but why it mattered for customer experience. She spotted a gap in the plan—something about data flow that would affect their personalization strategy.
>
> In the meeting that afternoon, she asked a question that stopped the room. The CTO paused, then smiled. "That's... actually a really good catch."
>
> Sarah didn't become a technical expert that day. She became something more valuable: a leader who could bridge worlds.
